### ES Modules in Node

We us ECMAScript Modules in the backend in this project. Be sure to have at least Node v14.6+ or you will need to add the "--experimental-modules" flag.

Also, when importing a file (not a package), be sure to add .js at the end or you will get a "module not found" error

You can also install and setup Babel if you would like.

### Env Variables

Create a .env file in then root and add the following

```
NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 5000
MONGO_URI = your mongodb uri
JWT_SECRET = 'abc123'
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = your paypal client id
```

### Install Dependencies (frontend & backend)

```
yarn install
cd frontend
yarn install
```

### Run

```
# Run frontend (:3000) & backend (:5000)
yarn run dev

# Run backend only
yarn run server
```

## Build & Deploy

```
# Create frontend prod build
cd frontend
yarn run build
```

## Tech Stack Used:

---

- The Project is bassed on MERN Stack which consists of javascript frameworks for front and backend development

- For the development of the backend we are using
        
    1. MongoDb as our NoSQL database
    2. Express.js as our routing library
    3. Node.js for server side capabilities

- For the development of the frontend we are using

    1. React.js as our responive frontend framework
    2. react-bootsrap for css styling
